<h3>1. Body Mass Index Calculator (150 points)</h3>
<h4>Overview:</h4>
<p>The team at sftwear wants get the needed information to compute a customers BMI and they&#39;ll turn that info into a T-Shirt.</p>
<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<p>You are going to build  a Body Mass Index Calculator.  You don&#39;t have the match the look and feel of the example below, but you do have to make the functionality work for imperial and metric. </p>
<p><strong>It are required to use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JQuery validator</li>
<li>JQuery UI</li>
<li>Be a single page (not two pages).  </li>
<li>Must support imperial and metric.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other JQuery pluggins</li>
<li>Fancybox</li>
<li>surprise me</li>
</ul>
<h4>Helpful Hints:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
In D2L you can find a file named Project8Helpers.zip. 
<ul>
<li>This includes a sample page, CalcBMIFunctions.html, that uses the functions in BMICalcHelper.js to calculate BMI.</li>
<li>This was covered extensively in class</li>
<li>Given your input you call this code to do the calculation of BMI FOR YOU.  Help you help you by using them.</li>
<li>Project8Helpers.zip also includes CalcBMIFunctionsOnLine.html, which also shows how call a cloud service to do the imperial and metric calculations.  You don&#39;t have to use it, but you can if you want to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An example BMI calculator can be found at <a rel="noopener" href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/bmicalc.htm" title="NIH Website">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/bmicalc.htm</a>.  This is ONLY meant as test site where you can plug in heights and weights and validate that your own application is working.  </li>
</ul>
